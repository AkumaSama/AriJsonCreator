## To begin

  

When you launch AriJsonCreator you are on HomePanel, this panel is just for settings and support me.

After when you click on "Start now !" you can put a message for an maintenance and disable or enable a maintenance.

On the next panel you must enter the url which will contain everything you want to download.

Après séléctionez le dossier qui sera sur votre FTP.

Finally enter the name of the files / folders which should not be deleted by the updater.

After that you just have to copy the generated JSON and paste it into a .json document.
